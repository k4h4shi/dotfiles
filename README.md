k4h4shi's dotfiles

first, I should tell that this dotfiles heavily inspired b4b4r07's dotfiles.
"https://github.com/b4b4r07/dotfiles.git"

if you looking for good one you should use his one instead.

I just want build mine so I do but I don't think It's fit you.

this dotfiles just started to build, so It's still not for someone except me.

but if you would like to see my newbie rubish, feel free to do so.

Installation

git clone https://github.com/k4h4shi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make install
